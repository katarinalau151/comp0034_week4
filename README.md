# COMP0034 Week 4 code

This is the code to accompany the week 4 activities on Moodle. The repository is not standalone and should only be used
in conjunction with the Moodle activities.

### Exercises

Some of the exercises in this repository are adapted from a tutorial written by DÃ©borah Mesquita
in [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-and-why-i-used-plotly-instead-of-d3-to-visualize-my-lollapalooza-data-d48345e2ca68/)
. Her [source code is in GitHub](https://github.com/dmesquita/dash-lollapalooza-brasil-2018).

The exercises have also been supplemented with guidance from the
official [Dash documentation and tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com).

Go the the `exercises` directory for the exercise instructions.

The following are included:

- `1_intro_plotly_graph_objects.ipynb`
- `2_create_lollapalooza_charts_go.ipynb`
- `3_intro_plotly_dash.ipynb`
- `4_create_dash_app_in_IDE.md`
- `5_create_dashboard.md`

By now you should know how to do the following, if not please refer to the instructions from earlier weeks of the course
or use the online documentation from your IDE.

1. Copy the repository from the GitHub classroom link in Moodle week 4.
2. Clone the repository in your chosen IDE.
3. Create a venv in the repository directory.

There is no Flask app this week so you do not need to check the Flask configuration.
